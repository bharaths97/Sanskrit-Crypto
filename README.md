Abstract of the project:
With the constant evolution of cyber-threats, the necessity to develop robust cryptographic algorithms
becomes paramount. This project explores the potential of Sanskrit grammar and literature to enhance
cryptographic techniques. The rich structure of Sanskrit offers unique elements like Katapayadi
Sankhya (number encoding) and root words with their transformative abilities. Additionally, the
metrical rules of Sanskrit literature, from Pingala’s Chandaḥśāstra, present possibilities for complex
algorithmic structures. This research aims to bridge the gap between these fields by analyzing these
linguistic elements. The project seeks to theoretically integrate them with cryptographic algorithms,
paving the way for potential advancements in information security.
